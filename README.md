# Distributed Key-Value Store
This project is my attempt to create a fault-tolerant, distributed key-value store in Python. It is based on [NUS' Distributed Systems Lab](https://github.com/nus-sys/cs5223-labs), which, in turn, is based on [Ellis Michael's DSLabs](https://ellismichael.com/dslabs/).


## Getting started
To install the source code as editable package, run:
```
pip install -e .
```
